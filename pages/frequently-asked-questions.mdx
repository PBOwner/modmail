### Error installing from Pipfile and Pipfile.lock

First, make sure you have a compatible Python version.

Second, remove the broken `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` with:
```bash
rm Pipfile && rm Pipfile.lock
```

Fetch in the changes from the remote repository:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

And then, fetch the original files with:
```bash
git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- Pipfile && git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- Pipfile.lock
```
