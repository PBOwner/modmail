# Introduction

This is the documentation for a fork of [modmail-dev/Modmail](https://github.com/modmail-dev/Modmail), a Discord Modmail bot written in Python.

Modmail is a self-hosted Python Discord bot for your server. 
It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.
Users create a ticket by direct-messaging the bot on Discord, and it will create a ticket channel
in your chosen server relaying the messages between you and the server staff seamlessly.

It comes with many advanced features and customizable configurations to help you handle tickets smoothly,
such as custom snippets, command aliases, adding multiple users and so on.

With the Logviewer plugin, you can also view previous tickets created on your browser:

## Features

### Highly customisable

* Changeable bot status, prefix, category, log channel, etc.
* Versatile command permission system.
* Interface elements (color, responses, reactions, etc.).
* Snippets and command aliases.
* Minimum duration for accounts to be created before allowed to contact Modmail (`account_age`).
* Minimum length for members to be in the guild before allowed to contact Modmail (`guild_age`).

### Advanced logging functionality

* When you close a thread, Modmail will generate a log link and post it to your log channel.
* Native Discord dark-mode feel.
* Markdown/formatting support.
* Discord authentication-protected logs.
* See past logs of a user with `?logs`.
* Searchable by text queries using `?logs search`.

### Robust implementation

* Ease of installation: you can get your Modmail bot running in under 10 minutes!
* Schedule tasks in human time, e.g. `?close in 2 hours silently`.
* Editing and deleting messages are synced.
* Support for the diverse range of message contents (multiple images, files).
* Paginated commands interfaces via reactions.

This list is ever-growing thanks to active development by our exceptional contributors. See a full list of available commands by using the `?help` command.
