# Running Modmail on Docker

## Installing Docker Engine

Docker has their own installation page for popular Linux-based distros, read them by visiting the link below:

    title="Install Docker"
    href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/"
  />

If you're on a desktop environment, refer to the "Desktop" section of their documentation as Docker Desktop also comes with nice GUI that you manage your deployments with.

For VPS and servers, refer to the "Server" section as you will be needed to learn the CLI commands to run Modmail with Docker.

After the installation process has finished, you can try running the commands below in your terminal to see if **Docker** and **Docker Compose** has been installed successfully:

```shell
docker --version
docker compose version
```

You may need to change your Docker Compose command to `docker-compose --version` depending on the version you have installed.
</Callout>

## Running the image for Modmail

You can pull the latest stable image from Modmail repository by using the following command:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/raidensakura/modmail:stable
```

This will take some time depending on the speed of your network. It will also update the already existing image if you have previously pulled the same image before.

After that, you can run the bot as a container with the following command:

```shell
docker run -d --name modmail \
--env-file /path/to/.env \
--restart always ghcr.io/raidensakura/modmail:stable
```

Make sure to change `/path/to/.env` to the location of the `.env` file containing all the variables that you want the bot to start with.
Refer to the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page for instructions on where to obtain these values.

After deploying, you can view the logs of your currently running Modmail container with the following command:

```shell
docker logs modmail
```

You can stop your running Modmail container with:

```shell
docker stop modmail
```

Stopping the container does not remove the container files, so you can start it back up with:

```shell
docker start modmail
```

If you want to stop and remove the container completely, you can do so with:

```shell
docker rm -f modmail
```

The `-f` will forcefully remove and delete the container even if it's currently running. You can omit the flag if the container is already stopped.

## Building the image locally

You can also build the image locally on your machine if the repository files are already in your machine. In your Modmail project folder, simply run the build command below:

```shell
docker build . -t myname/modmail:latest
```

The `.` in the command will use the `Dockerfile` in the Modmail repository as the build steps. The `-t` flag will specify the image tag so it's easier for us to differentiate between multiple images in our system. Verify if the image is successfully built with the following command:

```shell
docker images
```

You should be able to see the tag we just used in the list:

<Image src="/docker-image-ls.png" alt="Hello" width={700} height={500} />

Now you can use the `docker run` command to run your bot using your locally-built image:

```shell
docker run -d --name modmail \
--env-file /path/to/.env \
--restart always myname/modmail:latest
```

## Updating on Docker

Auto-update is disabled when running Docker as container state is not persistent across restart.
To update your bot, you will need to update the base image by running the pull command:
```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/raidensakura/modmail:stable
```
command from previous step.
After that, simply recreate the container with the updated files:

```shell
docker rm -f ghcr.io/raidensakura/modmail:stable
docker run -d --name modmail \
--env-file /path/to/.env \
--restart always ghcr.io/raidensakura/modmail:stable
```

If your image is created locally, simply replace the `docker pull` command with `git pull` and rebuild your image again.

To automate this process on Docker, you can look into running [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) which will auto-update your containers whenever a new image is pushed on the remote repository. Please refer to their documentation for guide and configuration.
