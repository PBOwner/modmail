# Base Configuration

This forked version of Modmail also inherits all of the base configuration of the original project.
See all of the variable listing on the official project [Documentation](https://docs.modmail.dev/usage-guide/configuration).

Additionally, you can also use `[p]config help` to see a list of all the variables and `[p]config help` to see the details of individual config.
