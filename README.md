## Why hard fork?

Modmail has quite a few significant problems with its feature implementations, ranging from improper Discord sticker support down to suboptimal user blocking feature. Inevitably, fixing these fundametal issues required backward-incompatible fixes and since Modmail is rather slow on updates, I decided to turn this into a public hard fork for other user's benefits and for the spirit of FOSS.

**Important disclaimer:** This fork is neither supported nor endorsed by the Official Modmail team. __Do not ask__ the official support team if you have issues on this forked version. Since most of the modifications implemented are backward-incompatible, I will not be responsible for the damage caused to your Modmail instance by using this fork.

## Installation

This is a general installation guide for developers. Refer to the [documentation](https://modmail-docs.netlify.app) for user guide.

This guide assumes you have installed **git**, a **compatible Python version** and [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed.

1. Clone the repository
    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/raidensakura/modmail
    $ cd modmail
    ```
2. Create a Discord bot account, grant the necessary intents, and invite the bot.
3. Create a MongoDB database and a user for the bot to connect to.
4. Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it with appropriate values.
5. Install project dependencies and run the bot.  
    ```console
    $ uv install
    $ uv run bot.py
    ```
7. [Optional] Load the logviewer plugin with `[p]plugin load logviewer`

## Running the Docker Image

This guide assume you already have Docker or Docker Compose installed.

- Running with docker:
  ```console
  $ docker run --env-file=.env --name=modmail ghcr.io/raidensakura/modmail:stable
